HiForest merging scripts
Author: Alex Barbieri

There are two sets of HiForest merging scripts in this directory:
1) A system based on hadd that can be submitted to condor over many jobs
make.sh
submit.sh
run.sh

2) A system based on a custom root macro that is more robust to changes in trees but is less tested.
mergeForest.C (merging code)
pmerge.sh (to submit to condor)
