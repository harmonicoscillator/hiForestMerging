HiForest merging scripts
Author: Alex Barbieri <luck@mit.edu>

There are two sets of HiForest merging scripts in this directory:
1) A system based on hadd that can be submitted to condor over many jobs
make.sh
submit.sh
run.sh

2) A system based on a custom root macro that is more robust to changes in trees but has no scheme (yet) for submitting to a batch system.
mergeForest_pPb.C
run_merge_script.sh
